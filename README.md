# A Keyboard for the Visually Impaired
This is a keyboard for people who are visually challenged, based on the popular Braille Script! We took a Linux Embedded Board (Onion Omega 2) and designed a circuit to replicate the dots in the Braille Script. The source code for the keyboard is being made Open-Source for anyone to use.
