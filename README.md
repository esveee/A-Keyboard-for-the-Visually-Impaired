# AKeyboard-For-The-Visually-Impaired
This is a keyboard for people who are visually challenged, the prototype for which was just built in $35! There are many such keyboards that exist in market right now that cost between 1000-3000 CAD, but we tried to do it differently and VOILA! The code is being made public for anyone to use. I hope this could become a reality soon!
